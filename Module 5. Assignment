# Question 1
#A. 
#The null hypothesis is that the mean breaking strength is at least 70 
#The Alt hypothesis is that the mean breaking strength is below 70

#B.
#Is there evidence that the machine is not meeting the manufacturer’s specifications for average strength? Use a 0.05 level of significance

z.half.alpha = qnorm(1-alpha/2)
c(-z.half.alpha, z.half.alpha)
xxx = 2 * pnorm(z) # lower tail 
xxx # two−tailed p−value 
# The machine is meeting the specifications based on the null hypothesis being correct.

#C.
#Compute the p value and interpret its meaning _______
xxx = 2 * pnorm(z) # lower tail 
xxx # two−tailed p−value
# The p value is greater than .05 meaning that we do not reject the null hypothesis

#D.
#What would be your answer in (B) if the standard deviation were specified as 1.75 pounds?______

#We should reject the null hypothesis as the p value is below .05
#E.
#What would be your answer in (B) if the sample mean were 69 pounds and the standard deviation is 3.5 pounds? ______

#Question 2
#If x̅ = 85, σ = standard deviation = 8, and n=64, set up 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean μ.

#Question 3
#a. Calculate the correlation coefficient for this data set _____
x<-c(92,108,135)
y<-c(95.9,113,141) 
df<- data.frame(x,y)
cor(x,y)
#b. Pearson correlation coefficient _____
cor(df,method="pearson") #As pearson correlation
cor(df, method="spearman") #As spearman correlation
#c. Create plot of the correlation
corrgram(cor(df,method="pearson"))
corrgram(cor(df,method="spearman"))
